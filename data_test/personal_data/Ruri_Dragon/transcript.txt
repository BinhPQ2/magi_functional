<name>Other<endname>: Eh...?
<name>Other<endname>: All of a sudden
<name>ruri<endname>: I grew horns
<name>ruri<endname>: Am I really human?
<name>ruri<endname>: Mom, about this...
<name>ruri<endname>: Oh, Mor- Ning Honey.
<name>ruri<endname>: This thing on my head ...
<name>ruri<endname>: It's horns.
<name>ruri<endname>: You know this?
<page>02<endpage>
<name>mom<endname>: But why did they...
<name>mom<endname>: Ah, that's because you're not a human.
<name>mom<endname>: Since your Dad
<name>mom<endname>: Is a Dragon
<name>mom<endname>: According to your Dad, your body will start to change when you're 15.
<name>mom<endname>: I didn't expect the horns to grow overnight though.
<name>mom<endname>: Anyways, eat your breakfast.
<page>03<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: WHAT:...
<name>Other<endname>: What is this "Dragon" about?
<name>unsure<endname>: DORAGON.
<name>ruri<endname>: I didn't ask for its nickname.
<name>ruri<endname>: But what is this all about? Having these horns means I'm a dragon now?
<name>ruri<endname>: Yep, you look exactly like your dad.
<name>ruri<endname>: Hold on... my dad is an actual dragon...?
<name>Other<endname>: Didn't I tell you?
<page>04<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: You have the blood of a dragon
<name>ruri<endname>: Since you're a child of a human and a dragon.
<name>ruri<endname>: YOU'RE KIDDING ME, ARENT YOU?
<name>ruri<endname>: If I was kidding, then how come you have those horns on your head?
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...
<name>ruri<endname>: I'm going out for work now.
<name>ruri<endname>: How about you? Are you going to school?
<page>05<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Well.... I can't just not go.
<name>mom<endname>: Huh...
<name>mom<endname>: Then I'm going now.
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah! Mom, wait a minute!
<name>mom<endname>: Calm down, it's not like it's going to kill you or anything.
<name>ruri<endname>: What the hell is going on?
<name>ruri<endname>: Be sure to lock the door when you're out.

<name>ruri<endname>: Crap!
<name>ruri<endname>: I'm late?!
<page>06<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Phew! I should be on time...
<name>ruri<endname>: These are definitely going to draw attention
<page>07<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: But I can't skip classes, nor can I go out like this...
<name>ruri<endname>: Oh, well
<name>ruri<endname>: It's just the horns, I should probably be fine.
<name>ruri<endname>: Oh yeah, have to lock the doors...
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... wait!
<name>ruri<endname>: We will be leaving soon!
<name>unsure<endname>: Doors are close- ing.
<name>ruri<endname>: Phew... that was close...
<page>08<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Hmmm ...
<name>ruri<endname>: What's a Dragon Actually?
<name>ruri<endname>: Come to think of it, isn't it a mythical creature?
<name>ruri<endname>: My identity is that ambiguous?
<name>Other<endname>: Am I really one of these?
<name>ruri<endname>: What are these horns even?
<name>ruri<endname>: What's going on...
<name>ruri<endname>: I should just ask mom later.
<name>ruri<endname>: I can't do anything about these newly- grown horns anyways.
<page>09<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: I feel like I'm being stared at::
<name>Other<endname>: I'm definitely being stared at...
<name>Other<endname>: Most likely due to these horns.
<name>ruri<endname>: Who was it?
<name>ruri<endname>: That was clearly the shutter.
<page>10<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... forget about it...
<name>unsure<endname>: Good morning!
<name>ukka<endname>: Ah! Ruri-chan good worn-
<name>ukka<endname>: Eh?! what are those on your head?!
<name>teacher<endname>: Morning class.
<name>teacher<endname>: I hope you're all here.
<page>11<endpage>
<name>teacher<endname>: Woah, what are those, aoki?
<name>Other<endname>: Yes, sir?
<name>ruri<endname>: Erm... These horns
<name>ruri<endname>: kind of grew by themselves this morning...
<name>Other<endname>: Really...
<name>teacher<endname>: You're fine, right?
<name>Other<endname>: I guess so.
<name>teacher<endname>: Alright then.
<name>teacher<endname>: Got away with it....
<page>12<endpage>
<name>teacher<endname>: I really hate them staring at me like that
<name>Other<endname>: Hey, what did you do? Can I grow one like yours?
<name>ukka<endname>: No clue... I woke up and...
<name>Other<endname>: Ahahaha, are you a demon?
<name>ruri<endname>: No, my mom said that I was a dragon...
<name>ruri<endname>: Woah, that looks so cool!
<name>ruri<endname>: Dragon?
<name>Other<endname>: Can I take a picture?
<name>unsure<endname>: silence, classes have already started.
<name>ruri<endname>: Please... stop talking about it....
<page>13<endpage>
<name>ukka<endname>: Hey, hey.
<name>ukka<endname>: How do they feel like?
<name>ukka<endname>: Can I touch them for a bit?
<name>mom<endname>: Huh,!?
<name>mom<endname>: Eh... now?
<name>ukka<endname>: Pretty please!
<page>14<endpage>
<name>ukka<endname>: Here
<name>teacher<endname>: Stop when he turns back, OK?
<name>ukka<endname>: Woah... Thanks!
<name>ruri<endname>: Woah, what...
<name>ruri<endname>: It's not like they can't be touched ...
<name>ruri<endname>: But...
<name>ruri<endname>: H... how is it?
<name>ukka<endname>: Uhm... quite hard.
<name>ukka<endname>: It feels weird.
<name>teacher<endname>: Hey, what are you guys doing?
<page>15<endpage>
<name>teacher<endname>: I'm jealous...let me have a go.
<name>Other<endname>: Ah, me too.
<name>Other<endname>: Here it goes ...
<name>ruri<endname>: Boys are not allowed!
<name>ukka<endname>: What kind of logic is that?
<name>teacher<endname>: Ehhh...:: stingy.
<name>teacher<endname>: Then I will tease you lots, tsukimi. How about it?
<name>ukka<endname>: No, please..., then...
<name>ruri<endname>: Only 5 minutes, ok?
<name>ruri<endname>: Oi, don't just decide that on your own like that.
<name>teacher<endname>: Guys!
<name>teacher<endname>: Do it later, ok?
<name>ruri<endname>: I`m sorry...
<page>16<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: This is disastrous ...
<name>ukka<endname>: Sorry...
<name>Other<endname>: It's all my fault...
<name>unsure<endname>: In the end, after school...
<name>unsure<endname>: My teacher joined in as well.
<name>unsure<endname>: And just like that, everyone touched my horns.
<name>ukka<endname>: It's OK,
<name>ukka<endname>: Not like it's gonna corrode anyways.
<name>unsure<endname>: It has already though...
<name>Other<endname>: Hah... so bored ...
<name>Other<endname>: So ...
<name>Other<endname>: This is the first time I've made the class this chaotic huh...
<name>ruri<endname>: Uhh...
<name>ruri<endname>: So cold
<page>17<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: AmhoY
<name>ruri<endname>: So hot!?
<name>ruri<endname>: !!?
<page>18<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Uhhh... What just happened?!
<name>unsure<endname>: I also breathed out fire while sneezing ...
<name>ruri<endname>: How did it- this won't cause any harm, will it?
<name>Other<endname>: What's this, a circus Perfor- Mance?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... hot...
<name>ruri<endname>: So hot!
<name>Other<endname>: !!
<name>Other<endname>: Hey, are you ok?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah!
<name>ruri<endname>: Hello, Mom?
<page>19<endpage>
<name>mom<endname>: Mom! What happened to my body?
<name>mom<endname>: You didn't tell me that I would spit fire when I sneezed!
<name>mom<endname>: Ah... is that so...
<name>mom<endname>: Now is not the time for that!
<name>mom<endname>: Why didn't you even explain what was going on with my body?
<name>mom<endname>: I just made a heck of a mess, you know?
<name>mom<endname>: Hey, what's wrong with your voice?
<name>mom<endname>: My throat was burnt!!
<name>mom<endname>: I spit fire and what's stranger is that I just threw up blood!!
<name>mom<endname>: Haha, you sure are a half- dragon.
<name>mom<endname>: How are you now?
<name>mom<endname>: Now?
<page>20<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: I'm stopping the blee- ding in the infirmary.
<name>ruri<endname>: Hey...
<name>ruri<endname>: Can you tell me everything you know about dragons?
<name>ukka<endname>: Please be quiet...
<name>ruri<endname>: It will be really troublesome for me if this happens again...
<name>ruri<endname>: About that...
<name>ruri<endname>: I don't know much about it, either.
<name>ruri<endname>: What?
<name>ruri<endname>: I would have told you had I known.
<name>ruri<endname>: By the way, no sneezing for the rest of the day.
<name>ruri<endname>: Don't be absurd!
<name>unsure<endname>: Well then, back to work now.
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah!!
<page>21<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Hey Sensei, teach me how to stop my sneezing!
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...
<name>mom<endname>: I'm home!
<name>mom<endname>: Ruri?
<page>22<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Uwah, what's wrong?
<name>ruri<endname>: Oh, welcome home.
<name>ruri<endname>: Why the face? What's wrong?
<name>ruri<endname>: I spit fire three times after that and got burned.
<name>ruri<endname>: hat xi!
<name>ruri<endname>: Are you ok?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... mou... I really shouldn't have gone to school if this was going to happen.
<name>ruri<endname>: Yep, I didn't expect you to go to school either.
<name>ruri<endname>: Take a day off tomorrow.
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...?
<page>23<endpage>
<name>mom<endname>: Do you want to see your dad?
<name>mom<endname>: ::?
<name>mom<endname>: Uwah, what is this...
<page>24<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Chinese dragons are no jokes.
<name>ruri<endname>: deer,
<name>ruri<endname>: Hawk.
<name>ruri<endname>: snake,
<name>mom<endname>: Carp,
<name>ruri<endname>: What is this 'when'**?
<name>Other<endname>: com,
<name>unsure<endname>: You'll get sick.
<name>Other<endname>: tiger,
<name>Other<endname>: Rabbit,
<name>Other<endname>: CAMEL?!
<name>ruri<endname>: So... what creature am I?
<name>mom<endname>: I said I don't know.
<name>mom<endname>: I'm going to sleep now, don't wake me up.
<name>mom<endname>: This woman...
<name>ruri<endname>: Mom, what's going on with my body?
<name>ruri<endname>: Can I fly as well?
<name>ruri<endname>: Last night
<name>mom<endname>: Ahaha! You read too many Mangas!
<name>ruri<endname>: but i spit fire.
<page>25<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Don't ask me about it.
<name>ruri<endname>: Save it for your Dad.
<name>ruri<endname>: So...
<name>ukka<endname>: She told me to figure all these out myself.
<name>ukka<endname>: HAH
<name>ukka<endname>: HAH
<name>ukka<endname>: Why am I here so deep in the mourn- tains...
<name>ukka<endname>: HAH
<name>Other<endname>: Mom!
<name>ruri<endname>: Why now?
<name>ruri<endname>: AH...?
<page>26<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: both meeting Dad, and the whole "dragon" situation.
<name>ruri<endname>: Why did you keep all those things to yourself?
<name>ruri<endname>: Why didn't you tell me before all these happened?
<name>ruri<endname>: Would you have believed me if I had done so?
<name>ruri<endname>: ... maybe not.
<name>ruri<endname>: There are things...
<name>ruri<endname>: that you need to figure out yourself instead of asking.
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...
<name>ruri<endname>: Seri- Ously, this woman.
<page>27<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: What are you up to this time?
<name>Other<endname>: If mom keeps playing house like that...
<name>Other<endname>: This smart daughter of yours won't be so happy.
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... no good.
<name>ruri<endname>: I have to take a break here.
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...
<name>ruri<endname>: Go straight ahead and you will see an old shrine.
<name>ruri<endname>: Go by yourself.
<name>ruri<endname>: Ehh...
<name>ruri<endname>: It's in the shrine, right?
<name>ruri<endname>: Yep.
<page>28<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: CRAP: I'm so tired to go back now...
<name>ruri<endname>: AND IT'S TOO FAR...
<name>ruri<endname>: HAH
<name>ruri<endname>: Finally made it...
<name>ruri<endname>: This place...
<name>ruri<endname>: Does seem really old.
<name>ruri<endname>: No one probably manages it anymore.
<name>ruri<endname>: !!
<page>29<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: H!!!...
<name>ruri<endname>: AH... Um...
<page>30<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: Hmmm:?! Ruri?!
<name>unsure<endname>: :!?
<name>ruri<endname>: Sorry, I didn't realize it was you.
<name>ruri<endname>: :?
<name>Other<endname>: I'm terribly sorry for scaring you...
<name>Other<endname>: It's been over 10 years since I last saw a human.
<page>31<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: But you finally came...
<name>Other<endname>: Time sure flies, I remember you were still so little back then...
<name>ruri<endname>: He sure is Tal- Kative.
<name>ruri<endname>: He's H-Huge, but I can talk to him fortunately.
<name>ruri<endname>: UMM...
<name>ruri<endname>: I have something to ask.
<name>ruri<endname>: Hmm...
<name>Other<endname>: Let's head inside first.
<name>unsure<endname>: You must be tired.
<page>32<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: How's UMI now?
<name>ruri<endname>: Yes?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah! Mom!
<name>unsure<endname>: She's resting down there
<name>unsure<endname>: And told me to get here myself.
<name>unsure<endname>: Haha!
<name>unsure<endname>: She's still as lazy as ever
<name>unsure<endname>: But I'm relieved to hear that.
<name>ruri<endname>: This person... no, this dragon is really...
<name>ruri<endname>: My dad?
<name>ruri<endname>: So,
<name>ruri<endname>: What did you want to ask?
<name>Other<endname>: I will answer all of your Ques- Tions.
<name>ruri<endname>: !!
<name>Other<endname>: Yes...
<name>Other<endname>: You see...
<page>33<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: The first time I was in the middle of the
<name>ruri<endname>: How exactly did you two create me?
<name>Other<endname>: You came here just to ask me that!?
<name>Other<endname>: A-AH!
<name>ruri<endname>: Well, I'm curious.
<name>Other<endname>: Do you have any other Ques- Tions?
<name>Other<endname>: such as...
<name>Other<endname>: Mom suddenly told me that I was a dragon.
<name>ruri<endname>: Then I came all the way here knowing nothing.
<name>ruri<endname>: How exactly was I born?
<name>ruri<endname>: If you don't tell me, I will be really sad, you know...
<name>Other<endname>: Uh...
<page>34<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: Ask your mom.
<name>ruri<endname>: PFFETT... AHAHA!!
<name>ruri<endname>: W-WHAT ARE YOU LAUG- HING ABOUT?
<name>ruri<endname>: Sorry, I was just joking.
<name>ruri<endname>: I just wanted to ask.
<name>Other<endname>: Are you teas- ing me?
<name>ruri<endname>: I see.
<name>ruri<endname>: Though my dad looks like this.
<name>Other<endname>: This is how it feels to have a dad by your side.
<page>35<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Dad,
<name>ruri<endname>: Tell me something about dragons.
<name>ruri<endname>: I came all this way, you know...
<name>ruri<endname>: Heh... then,
<name>ruri<endname>: Did you first meet Mom here?
<name>unsure<endname>: That's right.
<name>ruri<endname>: Well, this is my shrine after all.
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah, Dad
<name>ruri<endname>: In that case...
<name>ruri<endname>: Can dragons fly?
<name>ruri<endname>: Despite having no wings...
<name>ruri<endname>: No, I do have wings.
<name>ruri<endname>: Hah?
<page>36<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: Do you want to fly with me?
<name>ruri<endname>: Yes?
<name>ruri<endname>: UWA!!!!
<name>ruri<endname>: Why-
<name>ruri<endname>: Where did they come from, Dad?!
<name>ruri<endname>: Concea-ling our wings
<name>ruri<endname>: is also the way of the dragon.
<page>37<endpage>
<name>Other<endname>: To be honest,
<name>Other<endname>: I have always wanted to carry you
<name>ruri<endname>: on my back and fly to the sky.
<name>ruri<endname>: Eh...?
<name>ruri<endname>: W-Wait UHM....
<name>ruri<endname>: Hold on tight!
<name>ruri<endname>: Dad, I haven't ...
<name>ruri<endname>: said "Yes" yet!
<name>ruri<endname>: Dad, it's fast, too fast!
<name>ruri<endname>: I'm gonna die!!!

<name>ruri<endname>: AHH... SO TIRED.
<name>ruri<endname>: How long is this going to take?
<name>ruri<endname>: I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AT ALL...!
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah
<name>ruri<endname>: Mom's here.
<name>ruri<endname>: Don't you two get along.
<name>Other<endname>: Yo, are you doing good?
<name>ruri<endname>: Hah...
<name>ruri<endname>: Hah...
<name>ruri<endname>: Hah...
<name>Other<endname>: You look like you are dying, umi.
<name>ruri<endname>: Live somewhere lower, Baka.
<name>ruri<endname>: Anyways, how are you two? Did something happen?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah... we just flew in the sky.
<page>40<endpage>
<name>mom<endname>: Eh... you can fly?
<name>ruri<endname>: Not until last year.
<name>unsure<endname>: Want me to show you?
<name>mom<endname>: Ohhh, is this the infamous "Lover's quarrel" I've heard of before?
<name>unsure<endname>: What?!
<name>ruri<endname>: I see...
<name>ruri<endname>: Now I know, who my real father is,
<name>ruri<endname>: And the origin of my horns. I finally get to know.
<name>Other<endname>: alrighty.
<name>mom<endname>: It's rare for us to get together like this, so let's take a picture together, shall we?
<name>mom<endname>: Ha?
<page>41<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: Come on, this is the first time we actually got together.
<name>ruri<endname>: C'mere, honey.
<name>ruri<endname>: Well...
<name>ruri<endname>: Gu...I guess so.
<name>ruri<endname>: What do you think? Since you already talked to your dad.
<name>ruri<endname>: Doesn't he seem more like a human than a monster?
<name>ruri<endname>: What?
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah, to be honest,
<name>ruri<endname>: He doesn't smell one bit like a monster.
<name>ruri<endname>: I wonder.
<name>ruri<endname>: Well, interesting creatures are everywhere.
<page>42<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: If I have to compare, then...
<name>ruri<endname>: You still look more like a human.
<name>ruri<endname>: So don't worry.
<name>ruri<endname>: OK, we have 10 seconds.
<name>Other<endname>: Didn't you tell me that I wasn't a human?
<name>ruri<endname>: I don't remember~
<name>ruri<endname>: To be honest,
<name>ruri<endname>: Even if I'm not a human,
<name>ruri<endname>: It's not the end of the world, but...
<name>ruri<endname>: Ah,
<name>ruri<endname>: Sorry.
<name>ruri<endname>: ?.
<page>43<endpage>
<name>unsure<endname>: I messed up the camera's angle.
<name>unsure<endname>: WRONG ONE!
<name>ruri<endname>: It's OK, give it to me.
<name>ruri<endname>: I will take the photo.
<page>44<endpage>
<name>ruri<endname>: One week later
<name>ruri<endname>: Um...
<name>ruri<endname>: Hm... What?
