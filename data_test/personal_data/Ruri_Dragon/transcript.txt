<Other>: Eh...?
<Other>: All of a sudden
<ruri>: I grew horns
<ruri>: Am I really human?
<ruri>: Mom, about this...
<ruri>: Oh, Mor- Ning Honey.
<ruri>: This thing on my head ...
<ruri>: It's horns.
<ruri>: You know this?
---------------------------------------------
<mom>: But why did they...
<mom>: Ah, that's because you're not a human.
<mom>: Since your Dad
<mom>: Is a Dragon
<mom>: According to your Dad, your body will start to change when you're 15.
<ruri>: I didn't expect the horns to grow overnight though.
<ruri>: Anyways, eat your breakfast.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: WHAT:...
<Other>: What is this "Dragon" about?
<unsure>: DORAGON.
<ruri>: I didn't ask for its nickname.
<ruri>: But what is this all about? Having these horns means I'm a dragon now?
<ruri>: Yep, you look exactly like your dad.
<ruri>: Hold on... my dad is an actual dragon...?
<Other>: Didn't I tell you?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: You have the blood of a dragon
<ruri>: Since you're a child of a human and a dragon.
<ruri>: You're kidding me, aren't you?
<ruri>: If I was kidding, then how come you have those horns on your head?
<ruri>: eh...
<ruri>: I'm going out for work now.
<ruri>: How about you? Are you going to school?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Well.... I can't just not go.
<mom>: Huh...
<mom>: Then I'm going now.
<ruri>: Ah! Mom, wait a minute!
<mom>: Calm down, it's not like it's going to kill you or anything.
<ruri>: What the hell is going on?
<ruri>: Be sure to lock the door when you're out.

<ruri>: Crap!
<ruri>: I'm late?!
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Phew! I should be on time...
<ruri>: These are definitely going to draw attention
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: But I can't skip classes, nor can I go out like this...
<ruri>: Oh, well
<ruri>: It's just the horns, I should probably be fine.
<ruri>: Oh yeah, have to lock the doors...
<ruri>: Ah... wait!
<ruri>: We will be leaving soon!
<unsure>: Doors are close- ing.
<ruri>: Phew... that was close...
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Hmmm ...
<ruri>: What's a Dragon Actually?
<ruri>: Come to think of it, isn't it a mythical creature?
<ruri>: My identity is that ambiguous?
<Other>: Am I really one of these?
<ruri>: What are these horns even?
<ruri>: What's going on...
<ruri>: I should just ask mom later.
<ruri>: I can't do anything about these newly- grown horns anyways.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: I feel like I'm being stared at::
<Other>: I'm definitely being stared at...
<Other>: Most likely due to these horns.
<ruri>: Who was it?
<ruri>: That was clearly the shutter.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Ah... forget about it...
<unsure>: Good morning!
<ukka>: Ah! Ruri-chan good worn-
<ukka>: Eh?! what are those on your head?!
<teacher>: Morning class.
<teacher>: I hope you're all here.
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: Woah, what are those, aoki?
<Other>: Yes, sir?
<ruri>: Erm... These horns
<ruri>: kind of grew by themselves this morning...
<Other>: Really...
<teacher>: You're fine, right?
<Other>: I guess so.
<teacher>: Alright then.
<teacher>: Got away with it....
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: I really hate them staring at me like that
<Other>: Hey, what did you do? Can I grow one like yours?
<ukka>: No clue... I woke up and...
<Other>: Ahahaha, are you a demon?
<ruri>: No, my mom said that I was a dragon...
<ruri>: Woah, that looks so cool!
<ruri>: Dragon?
<Other>: Can I take a picture?
<unsure>: silence, classes have already started.
<ruri>: Please... stop talking about it....
---------------------------------------------
<ukka>: Hey, hey.
<ukka>: How do they feel like?
<ukka>: Can I touch them for a bit?
<mom>: Huh,!?
<mom>: Eh... now?
<ukka>: Pretty please!
---------------------------------------------
<ukka>: Here
<teacher>: Stop when he turns back, OK?
<ukka>: Woah... Thanks!
<ruri>: Woah, what...
<ruri>: It's not like they can't be touched ...
<ruri>: But...
<ruri>: H... how is it?
<ukka>: Uhm... quite hard.
<ukka>: It feels weird.
<teacher>: Hey, what are you guys doing?
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: I'm jealous...let me have a go.
<Other>: Ah, me too.
<Other>: Here it goes ...
<ruri>: Boys are not allowed!
<ukka>: What kind of logic is that?
<teacher>: Ehhh...:: stingy.
<teacher>: Then I will tease you lots, tsukimi. How about it?
<ukka>: No, please..., then...
<ruri>: Only 5 minutes, ok?
<ruri>: Oi, don't just decide that on your own like that.
<teacher>: Guys!
<teacher>: Do it later, ok?
<ruri>: I`m sorry...
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: This is disastrous ...
<ukka>: Sorry...
<Other>: It's all my fault...
<unsure>: In the end, after school...
<unsure>: My teacher joined in as well.
<unsure>: And just like that, everyone touched my horns.
<ukka>: It's OK,
<ukka>: Not like it's gonna corrode anyways.
<unsure>: It has already though...
<Other>: Hah... so bored ...
<Other>: So ...
<Other>: This is the first time I've made the class this chaotic huh...
<ruri>: Uhh...
<ruri>: So cold
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: AmhoY
<ruri>: So hot!?
<ruri>: !!?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Uhhh... What just happened?!
<unsure>: I also breathed out fire while sneezing ...
<ruri>: How did it- this won't cause any harm, will it?
<Other>: What's this, a circus Perfor- Mance?
<ruri>: Ah... hot...
<ruri>: So hot!
<Other>: !!
<Other>: Hey, are you ok?
