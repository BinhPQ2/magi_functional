---------------------------------------------
<Other>: Eh...?
<Other>: All of a sudden
<ruri>: I grew horns
<ruri>: Am I really human?
<ruri>: Mom, about this...
<ruri>: Oh, Mor- Ning Honey.
<ruri>: This thing on my head ...
<ruri>: It's horns.
<ruri>: You know this?
---------------------------------------------
<mom>: But why did they...
<mom>: Ah, that's because you're not a human.
<mom>: Since your Dad
<mom>: Is a Dragon
<mom>: According to your Dad, your body will start to change when you're 15.
<mom>: I didn't expect the horns to grow overnight though.
<mom>: Anyways, eat your breakfast.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: WHAT:...
<Other>: What is this "Dragon" about?
<unsure>: DORAGON.
<ruri>: I didn't ask for its nickname.
<ruri>: But what is this all about? Having these horns means I'm a dragon now?
<ruri>: Yep, you look exactly like your dad.
<ruri>: Hold on... my dad is an actual dragon...?
<Other>: Didn't I tell you?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: You have the blood of a dragon
<ruri>: Since you're a child of a human and a dragon.
<ruri>: YOU'RE KIDDING ME, ARENT YOU?
<ruri>: If I was kidding, then how come you have those horns on your head?
<ruri>: Eh...
<ruri>: I'm going out for work now.
<ruri>: How about you? Are you going to school?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Well.... I can't just not go.
<mom>: Huh...
<mom>: Then I'm going now.
<ruri>: Ah! Mom, wait a minute!
<mom>: Calm down, it's not like it's going to kill you or anything.
<ruri>: What the hell is going on?
<ruri>: Be sure to lock the door when you're out.

<ruri>: Crap!
<ruri>: I'm late?!
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Phew! I should be on time...
<ruri>: These are definitely going to draw attention
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: But I can't skip classes, nor can I go out like this...
<ruri>: Oh, well
<ruri>: It's just the horns, I should probably be fine.
<ruri>: Oh yeah, have to lock the doors...
<ruri>: Ah... wait!
<ruri>: We will be leaving soon!
<unsure>: Doors are close- ing.
<ruri>: Phew... that was close...
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Hmmm ...
<ruri>: What's a Dragon Actually?
<ruri>: Come to think of it, isn't it a mythical creature?
<ruri>: My identity is that ambiguous?
<Other>: Am I really one of these?
<ruri>: What are these horns even?
<ruri>: What's going on...
<ruri>: I should just ask mom later.
<ruri>: I can't do anything about these newly- grown horns anyways.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: I feel like I'm being stared at::
<Other>: I'm definitely being stared at...
<Other>: Most likely due to these horns.
<ruri>: Who was it?
<ruri>: That was clearly the shutter.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Ah... forget about it...
<unsure>: Good morning!
<ukka>: Ah! Ruri-chan good worn-
<ukka>: Eh?! what are those on your head?!
<teacher>: Morning class.
<teacher>: I hope you're all here.
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: Woah, what are those, aoki?
<Other>: Yes, sir?
<ruri>: Erm... These horns
<ruri>: kind of grew by themselves this morning...
<Other>: Really...
<teacher>: You're fine, right?
<Other>: I guess so.
<teacher>: Alright then.
<teacher>: Got away with it....
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: I really hate them staring at me like that
<Other>: Hey, what did you do? Can I grow one like yours?
<ukka>: No clue... I woke up and...
<Other>: Ahahaha, are you a demon?
<ruri>: No, my mom said that I was a dragon...
<ruri>: Woah, that looks so cool!
<ruri>: Dragon?
<Other>: Can I take a picture?
<unsure>: silence, classes have already started.
<ruri>: Please... stop talking about it....
---------------------------------------------
<ukka>: Hey, hey.
<ukka>: How do they feel like?
<ukka>: Can I touch them for a bit?
<mom>: Huh,!?
<mom>: Eh... now?
<ukka>: Pretty please!
---------------------------------------------
<ukka>: Here
<teacher>: Stop when he turns back, OK?
<ukka>: Woah... Thanks!
<ruri>: Woah, what...
<ruri>: It's not like they can't be touched ...
<ruri>: But...
<ruri>: H... how is it?
<ukka>: Uhm... quite hard.
<ukka>: It feels weird.
<teacher>: Hey, what are you guys doing?
---------------------------------------------
<teacher>: I'm jealous...let me have a go.
<Other>: Ah, me too.
<Other>: Here it goes ...
<ruri>: Boys are not allowed!
<ukka>: What kind of logic is that?
<teacher>: Ehhh...:: stingy.
<teacher>: Then I will tease you lots, tsukimi. How about it?
<ukka>: No, please..., then...
<ruri>: Only 5 minutes, ok?
<ruri>: Oi, don't just decide that on your own like that.
<teacher>: Guys!
<teacher>: Do it later, ok?
<ruri>: I`m sorry...
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: This is disastrous ...
<ukka>: Sorry...
<Other>: It's all my fault...
<unsure>: In the end, after school...
<unsure>: My teacher joined in as well.
<unsure>: And just like that, everyone touched my horns.
<ukka>: It's OK,
<ukka>: Not like it's gonna corrode anyways.
<unsure>: It has already though...
<Other>: Hah... so bored ...
<Other>: So ...
<Other>: This is the first time I've made the class this chaotic huh...
<ruri>: Uhh...
<ruri>: So cold
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: AmhoY
<ruri>: So hot!?
<ruri>: !!?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Uhhh... What just happened?!
<unsure>: I also breathed out fire while sneezing ...
<ruri>: How did it- this won't cause any harm, will it?
<Other>: What's this, a circus Perfor- Mance?
<ruri>: Ah... hot...
<ruri>: So hot!
<Other>: !!
<Other>: Hey, are you ok?
<ruri>: Ah!
<ruri>: Hello, Mom?
---------------------------------------------
<mom>: Mom! What happened to my body?
<mom>: You didn't tell me that I would spit fire when I sneezed!
<mom>: Ah... is that so...
<mom>: Now is not the time for that!
<mom>: Why didn't you even explain what was going on with my body?
<mom>: I just made a heck of a mess, you know?
<mom>: Hey, what's wrong with your voice?
<mom>: My throat was burnt!!
<mom>: I spit fire and what's stranger is that I just threw up blood!!
<mom>: Haha, you sure are a half- dragon.
<mom>: How are you now?
<mom>: Now?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: I'm stopping the blee- ding in the infirmary.
<ruri>: Hey...
<ruri>: Can you tell me everything you know about dragons?
<ukka>: Please be quiet...
<ruri>: It will be really troublesome for me if this happens again...
<ruri>: About that...
<ruri>: I don't know much about it, either.
<ruri>: What?
<ruri>: I would have told you had I known.
<ruri>: By the way, no sneezing for the rest of the day.
<ruri>: Don't be absurd!
<unsure>: Well then, back to work now.
<ruri>: Ah!!
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Hey Sensei, teach me how to stop my sneezing!
<ruri>: Eh...
<mom>: I'm home!
<mom>: Ruri?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Uwah, what's wrong?
<ruri>: Oh, welcome home.
<ruri>: Why the face? What's wrong?
<ruri>: I spit fire three times after that and got burned.
<ruri>: hat xi!
<ruri>: Are you ok?
<ruri>: Ah... mou... I really shouldn't have gone to school if this was going to happen.
<ruri>: Yep, I didn't expect you to go to school either.
<ruri>: Take a day off tomorrow.
<ruri>: Eh...?
---------------------------------------------
<mom>: Do you want to see your dad?
<mom>: ::?
<mom>: Uwah, what is this...
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Chinese dragons are no jokes.
<ruri>: deer,
<ruri>: Hawk.
<ruri>: snake,
<mom>: Carp,
<ruri>: What is this 'when'**?
<Other>: com,
<unsure>: You'll get sick.
<Other>: tiger,
<Other>: Rabbit,
<Other>: CAMEL?!
<ruri>: So... what creature am I?
<mom>: I said I don't know.
<mom>: I'm going to sleep now, don't wake me up.
<mom>: This woman...
<ruri>: Mom, what's going on with my body?
<ruri>: Can I fly as well?
<ruri>: Last night
<mom>: Ahaha! You read too many Mangas!
<ruri>: but i spit fire.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Don't ask me about it.
<ruri>: Save it for your Dad.
<ruri>: So...
<ukka>: She told me to figure all these out myself.
<ukka>: HAH
<ukka>: HAH
<ukka>: Why am I here so deep in the mourn- tains...
<ukka>: HAH
<Other>: Mom!
<ruri>: Why now?
<ruri>: AH...?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: both meeting Dad, and the whole "dragon" situation.
<ruri>: Why did you keep all those things to yourself?
<ruri>: Why didn't you tell me before all these happened?
<ruri>: Would you have believed me if I had done so?
<ruri>: ... maybe not.
<ruri>: There are things...
<ruri>: that you need to figure out yourself instead of asking.
<ruri>: Eh...
<ruri>: Seri- Ously, this woman.
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: What are you up to this time?
<Other>: If mom keeps playing house like that...
<Other>: This smart daughter of yours won't be so happy.
<ruri>: Ah... no good.
<ruri>: I have to take a break here.
<ruri>: Eh...
<ruri>: Go straight ahead and you will see an old shrine.
<ruri>: Go by yourself.
<ruri>: Ehh...
<ruri>: It's in the shrine, right?
<ruri>: Yep.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: CRAP: I'm so tired to go back now...
<ruri>: AND IT'S TOO FAR...
<ruri>: HAH
<ruri>: Finally made it...
<ruri>: This place...
<ruri>: Does seem really old.
<ruri>: No one probably manages it anymore.
<ruri>: !!
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: H!!!...
<ruri>: AH... Um...
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: Hmmm:?! Ruri?!
<unsure>: :!?
<ruri>: Sorry, I didn't realize it was you.
<ruri>: :?
<Other>: I'm terribly sorry for scaring you...
<Other>: It's been over 10 years since I last saw a human.
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: But you finally came...
<Other>: Time sure flies, I remember you were still so little back then...
<ruri>: He sure is Tal- Kative.
<ruri>: He's H-Huge, but I can talk to him fortunately.
<ruri>: UMM...
<ruri>: I have something to ask.
<ruri>: Hmm...
<Other>: Let's head inside first.
<unsure>: You must be tired.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: How's UMI now?
<ruri>: Yes?
<ruri>: Ah! Mom!
<unsure>: She's resting down there
<unsure>: And told me to get here myself.
<unsure>: Haha!
<unsure>: She's still as lazy as ever
<unsure>: But I'm relieved to hear that.
<ruri>: This person... no, this dragon is really...
<ruri>: My dad?
<ruri>: So,
<ruri>: What did you want to ask?
<Other>: I will answer all of your Ques- Tions.
<ruri>: !!
<Other>: Yes...
<Other>: You see...
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: The first time I was in the middle of the
<ruri>: How exactly did you two create me?
<Other>: You came here just to ask me that!?
<Other>: A-AH!
<ruri>: Well, I'm curious.
<Other>: Do you have any other Ques- Tions?
<Other>: such as...
<Other>: Mom suddenly told me that I was a dragon.
<ruri>: Then I came all the way here knowing nothing.
<ruri>: How exactly was I born?
<ruri>: If you don't tell me, I will be really sad, you know...
<Other>: Uh...
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: Ask your mom.
<ruri>: PFFETT... AHAHA!!
<ruri>: W-WHAT ARE YOU LAUG- HING ABOUT?
<ruri>: Sorry, I was just joking.
<ruri>: I just wanted to ask.
<Other>: Are you teas- ing me?
<ruri>: I see.
<ruri>: Though my dad looks like this.
<Other>: This is how it feels to have a dad by your side.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Dad,
<ruri>: Tell me something about dragons.
<ruri>: I came all this way, you know...
<ruri>: Heh... then,
<ruri>: Did you first meet Mom here?
<unsure>: That's right.
<ruri>: Well, this is my shrine after all.
<ruri>: Ah, Dad
<ruri>: In that case...
<ruri>: Can dragons fly?
<ruri>: Despite having no wings...
<ruri>: No, I do have wings.
<ruri>: Hah?
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: Do you want to fly with me?
<ruri>: Yes?
<ruri>: UWA!!!!
<ruri>: Why-
<ruri>: Where did they come from, Dad?!
<ruri>: Concea-ling our wings
<ruri>: is also the way of the dragon.
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: To be honest,
<Other>: I have always wanted to carry you
<ruri>: on my back and fly to the sky.
<ruri>: Eh...?
<ruri>: W-Wait UHM....
<ruri>: Hold on tight!
<ruri>: Dad, I haven't ...
<ruri>: said "Yes" yet!
<ruri>: Dad, it's fast, too fast!
<ruri>: I'm gonna die!!!
---------------------------------------------
<Other>: For more information on
<Other>: AHaha Haha!!!
<Other>: This is awesome!
<Other>: My ears are buzzing!
<Other>: Pro- Baby Air Pressure
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: AHH... SO TIRED.
<ruri>: How long is this going to take?
<ruri>: I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AT ALL...!
<ruri>: Ah
<ruri>: Mom's here.
<ruri>: Don't you two get along.
<Other>: Yo, are you doing good?
<ruri>: Hah...
<ruri>: Hah...
<ruri>: Hah...
<Other>: You look like you are dying, umi.
<ruri>: Live somewhere lower, Baka.
<ruri>: Anyways, how are you two? Did something happen?
<ruri>: Ah... we just flew in the sky.
---------------------------------------------
<mom>: Eh... you can fly?
<ruri>: Not until last year.
<unsure>: Want me to show you?
<mom>: Ohhh, is this the infamous "Lover's quarrel" I've heard of before?
<unsure>: What?!
<ruri>: I see...
<ruri>: Now I know, who my real father is,
<ruri>: And the origin of my horns. I finally get to know.
<Other>: alrighty.
<mom>: It's rare for us to get together like this, so let's take a picture together, shall we?
<mom>: Ha?
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: Come on, this is the first time we actually got together.
<ruri>: C'mere, honey.
<ruri>: Well...
<ruri>: Gu...I guess so.
<ruri>: What do you think? Since you already talked to your dad.
<ruri>: Doesn't he seem more like a human than a monster?
<ruri>: What?
<ruri>: Ah, to be honest,
<ruri>: He doesn't smell one bit like a monster.
<ruri>: I wonder.
<ruri>: Well, interesting creatures are everywhere.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: If I have to compare, then...
<ruri>: You still look more like a human.
<ruri>: So don't worry.
<ruri>: OK, we have 10 seconds.
<Other>: Didn't you tell me that I wasn't a human?
<ruri>: I don't remember~
<ruri>: To be honest,
<ruri>: Even if I'm not a human,
<ruri>: It's not the end of the world, but...
<ruri>: Ah,
<ruri>: Sorry.
<ruri>: ?.
---------------------------------------------
<unsure>: I messed up the camera's angle.
<unsure>: WRONG ONE!
<ruri>: It's OK, give it to me.
<ruri>: I will take the photo.
---------------------------------------------
<ruri>: One week later
<ruri>: Um...
<ruri>: Hm... What?
<ruri>: Something just grew...?
<ruri>: Even if surprises may come, be glad and accept it.
